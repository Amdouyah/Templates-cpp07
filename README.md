# Understanding Templates in C++

## Project Overview

This module is designed to help you understand **Templates** in C++. You will learn how to define and use templates to create generic functions and classes that work with any data type. Templates allow you to write more flexible and reusable code.

## Concepts Covered

- **Function Templates**: Create functions that work with any data type.
- **Class Templates**: Define classes that can handle various types of data.

## Requirements

- C++98 compliant compiler.
- **Makefile** for compilation.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Amdouyah/Templates-cpp07.git
